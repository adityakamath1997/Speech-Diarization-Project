# SpeakerLens: AI-Powered Transcript Analysis

This project was born out of a real need I experienced during my course curriculum's capstone project meetings. As our team discussions grew longer and more complex, I found myself wishing for a tool that could automatically track who said what and highlight the key points from each speaker. What started as a solution to my own problem - managing meeting notes and tracking speaker contributions - quickly evolved into a comprehensive audio analysis platform that could serve various business needs.

The tool combines my interests in data visualization and audio processing to create meaningful insights from spoken conversations. While it began as a solution for academic meetings, I realized its potential applications in various professional settings - from sales calls to research interviews. I'm excited to continue adding features and improving its capabilities!

## ✨ App Demo

For the sake of demonstration, I've chosen an audio clip extracted from the video of a staff meeting with multiple speakers on Youtube:

*Upload an audio file of your choice:*

*Summary of the transcript, relevant entites, sentiment analysis, and sensitive content check:*

**And just to demonstrate that the tool does indeed detect multiple topics and any sensitive content, this is an analysis of a 'Between Two Ferns' interview!:**

   - Analysis of speaking time and participation balance
   - Topic tracking and sentiment monitoring

2. **Sales Calls**
   - Customer-agent interaction patterns
   - Real-time sentiment tracking
   - Compliance monitoring for regulated industries

3. **Research Interviews**
   - Accurate multi-speaker transcription
   - Theme identification and categorization
   - Response pattern analysis

Each use case leverages the core features of speaker diarization, sentiment analysis, and topic detection while serving specific business needs.

## 💡 Learning Journey

This project has been transformative for my technical growth. What began as a simple need to track meeting discussions led me deep into the world of AI and data visualization. Through building this tool, I've gained hands-on experience with:

- **Audio Processing**: Learning how to handle and process audio data efficiently
- **Data Visualization**: Developing interactive and informative visualizations using matplotlib and streamlit
- **API Integration**: Working with AssemblyAI's powerful API suite
- **Web Development**: Building an interactive web application using Streamlit, including custom styling, responsive layouts, and user-friendly interfaces

The project has especially enhanced my data visualization skills - from creating basic charts to developing complex, interactive dashboards that provide immediate value to users. Each visualization was carefully designed to answer specific questions about the conversation dynamics.

## 🚀 Future Work

There’s a lot more I intend to do with this project! Here a few features I plan on implementing in the near future.

- **Enhanced AssemblyAI Features**: Currently, the project uses only a subset of AssemblyAI’s capabilities. Future updates will explore and integrate more of its features, such as advanced content safety analysis, summarization, and more detailed audio insights.
- **Speaker Profile Identification**: Analyze and identify speaker profiles, such as age or gender, using additional machine learning models.
- **Real-time Processing**: Expand support for real-time audio streaming and live analysis to provide insights as audio is being recorded or played. I think AssemblyAI already has capabilities for this, but I haven't yet experimented with real-time processing.
- **Topic Modeling and Improved Visualizations**: Incorporate additional NLP techniques for enhanced topic detection and provide more user-friendly and interactive visual insights, making it easier for users to understand complex audio data at a glance.
- **More Visualizations!**: Add further visualizations for additional features I'm hoping to implement.

... and a lot more that I haven't yet noted down!
